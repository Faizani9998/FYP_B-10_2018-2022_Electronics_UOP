# 🌦️ Smart IoT-Based Weather Station  

This project is a **smart IoT-based weather station** designed for efficient monitoring and analysis of meteorological data. It integrates sensors, microcontrollers, and cloud-based services to collect, process, and display environmental parameters with high accuracy and reliability.  

---

## 📌 Features  
- **Real-time Data Collection**: Gathers meteorological data from multiple sensors.  
- **Data Processing & Algorithms**: Ensures accurate computation and reliable results.  
- **ThingSpeak Cloud Integration**: Uploads sensor data to the open-source ThingSpeak IoT platform for storage, visualization, and analysis.  
- **Local Data Display**: Provides live readings on **TFT LCD** and **Matrix LCDs** for enhanced accessibility.  
- **Smart Control Actions**: Implements automated decisions based on analyzed datasets.
